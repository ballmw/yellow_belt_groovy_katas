This is a template for beginner level Groovy Katas done with tests in easyb specifications.  The katas are taken more or less from the [Coding Kata](http://codingkata.org) site.

I was inspired to do this by [Carin Meier](http://www.github.com/gigasquid) who was inspired by the oft-inspirational [Jim Weirich](http://www.github.com/jimweirich).  

I'm a beginner Groovy programmer so learning I set up this project with Gradle, instructions to get things set up are included below:

=======================================

# Setup instructions
Install Gradle

Go to a command line:
gradle clean check

optionally add --info or --debug

=======================================
# Branches

There are two branches, _master_ and _solutions_.  The _solutions_ branch contains the solutions.
=======================================
# Corrections

Please let me know if you see anything that can be done better, I'll be doing the orange_belt_groovy_katas next an want to do a great job.
